#used https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-do-you-reverse-a-string-in-python to learn how to 
# print a string backwards. In this instance, it is telling the computer to iterate through the string but take a step backwards
# each time, rather than reading it forwards.
sentence = input('Enter a string: ')

sentenceBack = sentence[::-1]
print(sentenceBack)
